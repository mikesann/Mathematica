# Mathematica
Some of the many, many Mathematica files I wrote for the course "Advanced Computational Problem Solving" at Western Kentucky University. The course earned me MIT transfer credit for "Introduction to Algorithms." Final Partner Project was a roller coaster simulator/game, which we were asked to present at the WKU Mathematics Symposium.
