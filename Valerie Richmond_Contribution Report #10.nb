I made the sin and random track option (and helped with the others), helped \
debug the Play button, got some of the pictures incorporated as backgrounds, \
got the cart to correctly display in 2D, made the Customize button and \
window, set standards for how many points are needed for each level (and \
added appropriate messages to let the user know the point standards--except \
the Help Button, which Julia did), helped transition track options to 3D \
(used Fit to find a line and points on it such that the z coordinates would \
be in a line, assigned the x and y coordinates of the xyzList), made the \
connection between the 3D and 2D lists so that the tracks relate (change one, \
other displays the change too), made View button switch between 2D and 3D \
(screens and the button name), made simple ViewAngle Pop up menu for \
adjusting the angle from which you see the 3D track, changed physics (I know \
by now not to say fixed) so that it no longer goes uphill in those weird \
cases, changed the structure of the code and feedback messages such that the \
user gets two chances at every level, formatted the 3D gamePlay screen, made \
the 3D coins and implemented coin collection, modified the Locator code \
Dr.Ziegler gave us to include multiple interconnected Locators (these are the \
two graphs on the 3D view screen), made the cart slide along the 3D track \
using some physics, smoothed out the feedBack[] method so it worked for 3D as \
well, attempted to use rotate to get the 3D cuboid to rotate along with the \
slope of the line\[LongDash]works but looks unrefined, and searched for an \
option which would simulate support beams on the 3D parametric plot of the \
track--got code to do that with a similar example from the Doc Center, but \
couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t get it to dynamically combine with the track.


Overall, I headed the play button/physics incorporation (gravity and \
friction), track restrictions, and the level structure with coins.
